# Effect.less - CSS3 Animation Library

### ABOUT

Effect.less is a cross-browser CSS3 animation library with predefined animation sequences that I use in my web projects. I would like to thank to [Daniel Eden] (https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) and [Christian Pucci] (https://github.com/miniMAC/magic) for their awesome libraries!


### Basic usage

1. Include the stylesheet on your document's "<head>"

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="effect.css">
</head>
```

2. Add the animation class to the element you want to animate via javascript.

```javascript
$("#button").addClass("fx-bounce");
```

3. You have list of over 100 animation classes.
